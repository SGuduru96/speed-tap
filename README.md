GOAL
====
A game in which the player is challeged by rows of tiles moving down the screen. The objective is to tap all of the tiles. The twist is that each there are 3 types of tiles. Each has a number on them. That number represents the amount of times it must be tapped to be destoryed. If the tile is not destroyed before it reaches the bottom of the screen, then the number on that tile is subtracted from the players health. (playerHealth -= outOfBoundsTile.tapsRemaining). The overall objective of this game is to get a high score. The more tiles destoryed the more pointed earned.
